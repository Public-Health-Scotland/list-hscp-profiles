# LIST Localities Profiles - HSCP version

This is a fork of the main Localities Profiles repository [https://github.com/Public-Health-Scotland/list-localities-profiles]() it should be kept up to date with the changes in that repo, whilst maintaining the differences that enable us to produce the profiles at HSCP level.
